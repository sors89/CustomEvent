# CustomEvent
A TShock plugin library for creating custom events in Terraria. </br>
**Important Note**: CustomEvent is still in development at the moment so some bugs are to be expected. Feel free to report them via the [Issues](https://github.com/sors89/CustomEvent/issues) tab. </br>
# Installation
Like many other TShock plugins, simply place `CustomEvent.dll` alongside `ExHooks.dll` in the `ServerPlugins` folder.
# How does this works?
By using IL editing technique to hook into Terraria's event code, we can manipulate it to execute our custom event as well! </br>
# State of development
Development is going slowly right now since this plugin isn’t my main focus.
I’ve got other things going on in real life, so I can only work on it when I have a bit of free time which isn’t often.</br>
# Upcoming features
- Provides a clear indication of event progress.
- Supports event with multi waves.
- Better API.
# ちなみに
- This plugin **requires** [ExHooks](https://github.com/sors89/ExHooks), another plugin library that provides extra hooks which might be useful for your TShock modding.
- This plugin is designed to offer a way to create custom event, **not** to provide any built-in events.
- This is my first time creating a library for others to use so there may be some imperfections. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!
- The `ExampleEvent` folder contains a sample custom event, feel free to check it out, it's pretty cool, seriously.
- Thanks for reading and have a good day ≧∇≦.
